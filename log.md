# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: Tuesday, October 9, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Worked on Webpack setup & config

**Thoughts:** Webpack seems quite complicated to setup and there's a lot to learn and so many different loaders & plugins all with different configurations. I suppose you can always refer to the documentation, but would be nice to be able to easily setup various configurations quickly and easily by just memory and understanding. I suppose as I continue to practice by setting up many, many different projects, this will come. As with anythiing, practice, practice, practice.
